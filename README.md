# TTL RISC-V

RISC-V processor & peripherals made (almost) entirely with 74-series TTL logic chips.

## Design Goals

* Supports the RV32IM instruction set.
* Runs at `16MHz` clock speed.
* Multi-stage pipeline.
* Single clock cycle instructions.
* Supports the 8080 bus interface.

## NOT Design Goals

* Out-of-order, I havn't figured out how to implement it yet :(
